### BOTPRESS INBOX

You can use and extend this inbox dashboard for managing conversations users had with your Botpress bot. It uses the official API (in Beta still).

# Features

-   List conversations
-   List messages of a conversation
-   List users of a conversation
-   Show details of conversation (tags and created/updated dates)
-   Send a new message to conversation
-   Delete conversation

# How to use

1. Download this project folder
2. Create a .env file in the root folder
3. Add the following variables to the .env file
   `VITE_BOTPRESS_TOKEN=<your token>
VITE_BOTPRESS_BOT_ID=<your bot id>
VITE_BOTPRESS_WORKSPACE_ID=<your workspace id>
VITE_BOTPRESS_BOT_ID_AS_USER=<your bot id as a user>`
4. Go to Botpress Dashboard, click your icon, and go to Personal Access Tokens
5. Create a new token named 'inbox-dashboard' for example, and paste it in the .env file
6. Still in the dashboard, open your bot and you will see the workspace and bot ids in the url. The workspace id is the string right after /workspaces/ and the bot id is right after /chatbots/. Copy and paste them in the .env file
7. Start the project with `npm run dev` and open it in the browser
8. To figure out your bot id as a user, open any conversation and go to the developer console. You will see a `MESSAGES: [...]` log. Open the list and look for the first message sent by the bot. Grab its userId and paste it in the .env file. This will be used for sending messages and for differentiating the bot from other users.
9. You're done!
